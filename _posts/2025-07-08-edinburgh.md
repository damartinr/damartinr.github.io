## The PHAIR 2025 Animal Advocacy Conference in Edinburgh

This July I had the chance to attend <a href='https://phairsociety.org/2025/07/08/phair-2025-conference-an-extraordinary-gathering/'>PHAIR 2025</a> in Edinburgh, my very first time at this conference, organized by the **PHAIR Society**. The Society for the Psychology of Human-Animal Intergroup Relations (PHAIR) is an association dedicated to building bridges between psychology and animal advocacy, bringing together researchers, advocates, and practitioners who care about the moral standing of animals and how we should act on it. The conference reflected this mission beautifully: it wasn’t only academics presenting their work, but also activists sharing practical perspectives. That combination made for a unique experience.  

The setting in Edinburgh couldn’t have been better. The city itself was beautiful, and the atmosphere of the conference was warm, energizing, and incredibly well-organized. I met so many fantastic people. One of the highlights was meeting <a href='https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer'>Peter Singer</a>, a philosopher whose work has shaped the field for decades. I also had the chance to connect with others whose research has been central to my own, like <a href='https://www.joshuarottman.com'>Josh Rottman</a>, <a href='https://www.mattiwilks.com'>Matti Wilks</a>, and <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlie-crimston-4b1229226/?originalSubdomain=au'>Charlie Crimston</a>.

Overall, PHAIR 2025 was an amazing mix of rigorous discussion and real-world engagement. It was a privilege to be part of a community where psychology and advocacy come together. Can't wait for the 2027 one!
