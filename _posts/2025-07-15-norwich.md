## Attending and presenting at the 5th European Experimental Philosophy Conference

Last week I had the chance to attend the <a href='https://x-phi.uea.ac.uk/EuroX-Phi2025-conference/'>EuroX-Phi 2025 conference</a> at the University of East Anglia in Norwich. The city itself was a lovely surprise, quiet, beautiful, and full of character, and the atmosphere of the event was just as welcoming. I got to meet some really nice people, exchange ideas informally, and enjoy the feeling of being part of this lifely community working on similar projects.

The conference also featured some fantastic keynotes, including a talk by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Knobe'>Josh Knobe</a> that sparked a lot of discussion. I presented my own project, *Practical Reason: Frequency and Evaluation Effects on Judgments of Normality and Reasonableness*, which is part of my broader project on how people think about normality and practical reasoning. 

It was great to share my work in this setting, get feedback, and see how it connects with other ongoing debates. Overall, it was an inspiring few days, both intellectually and personally.
