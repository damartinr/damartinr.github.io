Hello! My name is Daniel Martín, and I am currently pursuing a PhD in Philosophy at the <a href='https://www.ugr.es/en'>University of Granada</a>. I began my academic journey with a <a href='https://www.ugr.es/en/study/undergraduate/bachelors-degree-philosophy'>Bachelor's degree in Philosophy</a> at this same university, followed by a Master's degree in  <a href='https://venalacomplu.ucm.es/estudios/master-eticaaplicada'>Applied Ethics at the Complutense University of Madrid</a>. I have also recently completed a <a href='https://masteres.ugr.es/profesorado/'>Master's degree in Teaching</a>, and I am simultaneously pursuing a <a href='https://www.uned.es/universidad/inicio/en/estudios/grados/grado-en-psicologia.html?idContenido=1'>degree in Psychology at the UNED</a>.

My research lies at the intersection of philosophy and moral psychology. More specifically, my research could be described as the study of the psychology behind everyday moral decisions relating to other people, animals and the environment. To explore these issues, I combine, in collaboration with my <a href= 'https://www.mscilab.com/people/'>research team</a>, philosophical analysis with experimental methods.

For instance, we are currently studying how people understand the concepts of 'normal' and 'reasonable', and how these perceptions can be influenced by descriptive influences, what <i>is</i>, and by prescriptive ones, what <i>ought to be</i>. Such studies would help us understand how moral justification is justified socially and legally, and how these patterns may change (<a href='https://www.mscilab.com/projects/practicalreason/'>click here for more information</a>). 

In another line of work, we are analysing the moral priority that people attribute to different animals and plants. Using a simple behavioural task, we investigate the extent to which we feel morally close to different living beings, and the implications these perceptions have for dignity, rights, and duties of care and attention (<a href='https://www.mscilab.com/projects/animaldilemmas/'>click here for more information</a>).

Outside of research, I enjoy spending time outdoors, cooking, walking my dogs, and occasionally going on hiking trips. I believe that these activities, as well as contact with people and nature, also feed into my understanding of philosophy and moral psychology.
