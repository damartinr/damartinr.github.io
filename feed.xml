It was two weeks full of learning, discussions, and getting to know people from many different places and backgrounds.</p> <p>I joined the <em>Moral Psychology and Artificial Intelligence</em> workstream with <a href="https://www.jimaceverett.com">Jim Everett</a> and <a href="https://www.mgreinecke.com">Madeline (“Gracie”) Reinecke</a>. We looked at AI not just as a technology, but as something that raises deep questions about our values, our decisions, and the way we relate to each other in a world where machines are increasingly present. I found it both challenging and refreshing to think about how psychology, philosophy and AI come together, and how research can engage with these questions in practice.</p> <swiper-container keyboard="true" navigation="true" pagination="true" pagination-clickable="true" pagination-dynamic-bullets="true" rewind="true"> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/summer_school2025/6-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/6-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/6-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/summer_school2025/6.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 img-small" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/summer_school2025/3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/summer_school2025/3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 img-small" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/summer_school2025/4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/4-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/summer_school2025/4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 img-small" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/summer_school2025/5-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/5-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/5-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/summer_school2025/5.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 img-small" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/summer_school2025/2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/summer_school2025/2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 img-small" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/summer_school2025/1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/summer_school2025/1.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 img-small" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> </swiper-container> <p>Outside the classroom, there were plenty of activities that made the experience even richer: from exploring Canterbury to just spending time with others over a meal or during the organized events. Those moments mattered as much as the academic side, because they made it easy to connect, exchange ideas, and feel part of a wider community.</p> <p>Looking back, I’m grateful for the balance of learning, collaboration, and simply sharing experiences. The summer school wasn’t just about the science, but also about the people, the conversations, and the projects that will keep going long after. Thanks to everyone who made this possible.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="psychology"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[2025 Summer School of the European Association of Social Psychology, hosted at the University of Kent]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">PHAIR 2025 in Edinburgh</title><link href="https://damartinr.github.io/blog/2025/edinburgh/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="PHAIR 2025 in Edinburgh"/><published>2025-07-15T16:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-07-15T16:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://damartinr.github.io/blog/2025/edinburgh</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://damartinr.github.io/blog/2025/edinburgh/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-phair-2025-animal-advocacy-conference-in-edinburgh">The PHAIR 2025 Animal Advocacy Conference in Edinburgh</h2> <p>This July I had the chance to attend <a href="https://phairsociety.org/2025/07/08/phair-2025-conference-an-extraordinary-gathering/">PHAIR 2025</a> in Edinburgh, my very first time at this conference, organized by the <strong>PHAIR Society</strong>. The Society for the Psychology of Human-Animal Intergroup Relations (PHAIR) is an association dedicated to building bridges between psychology and animal advocacy, bringing together researchers, advocates, and practitioners who care about the moral standing of animals and how we should act on it. The conference reflected this mission beautifully: it wasn’t only academics presenting their work, but also activists sharing practical perspectives. That combination made for a unique experience.</p> <p>The setting in Edinburgh couldn’t have been better. The city itself was beautiful, and the atmosphere of the conference was warm, energizing, and incredibly well-organized. I met so many fantastic people. One of the highlights was meeting <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer">Peter Singer</a>, a philosopher whose work has shaped the field for decades. I also had the chance to connect with others whose research has been central to my own, like <a href="https://www.joshuarottman.com">Josh Rottman</a>, <a href="https://www.mattiwilks.com">Matti Wilks</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlie-crimston-4b1229226/?originalSubdomain=au">Charlie Crimston</a>.</p> <swiper-container keyboard="true" navigation="true" pagination="true" pagination-clickable="true" pagination-dynamic-bullets="true" rewind="true"> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/edinburgh2025/1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/edinburgh2025/1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/edinburgh2025/1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/edinburgh2025/1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 img-small" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/edinburgh2025/2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/edinburgh2025/2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/edinburgh2025/2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/edinburgh2025/2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 img-small" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/edinburgh2025/3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/edinburgh2025/3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/edinburgh2025/3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/edinburgh2025/3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 img-small" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/edinburgh2025/5-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/edinburgh2025/5-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/edinburgh2025/5-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/edinburgh2025/5.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 img-small" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/edinburgh2025/4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/edinburgh2025/4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/edinburgh2025/4-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/edinburgh2025/4.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 img-small" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/edinburgh2025/6-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/edinburgh2025/6-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/edinburgh2025/6-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/edinburgh2025/6.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 img-small" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> </swiper-container> <p>Overall, PHAIR 2025 was an amazing mix of rigorous discussion and real-world engagement.
