It was two weeks full of learning, discussions, and getting to know people from many different places and backgrounds.</p> <p>I joined the <em>Moral Psychology and Artificial Intelligence</em> workstream with <a href="https://www.jimaceverett.com">Jim Everett</a> and <a href="https://www.mgreinecke.com">Madeline (“Gracie”) Reinecke</a>. We looked at AI not just as a technology, but as something that raises deep questions about our values, our decisions, and the way we relate to each other in a world where machines are increasingly present. I found it both challenging and refreshing to think about how psychology, philosophy and AI come together, and how research can engage with these questions in practice.</p> <swiper-container keyboard="true" navigation="true" pagination="true" pagination-clickable="true" pagination-dynamic-bullets="true" rewind="true"> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/summer_school2025/6-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/6-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/6-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/summer_school2025/6.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 img-small" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/summer_school2025/3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/summer_school2025/3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 img-small" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/summer_school2025/4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/4-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/summer_school2025/4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 img-small" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/summer_school2025/5-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/5-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/5-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/summer_school2025/5.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 img-small" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/summer_school2025/2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/summer_school2025/2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 img-small" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/summer_school2025/1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/summer_school2025/1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/summer_school2025/1.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 img-small" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> </swiper-container> <p>Outside the classroom, there were plenty of activities that made the experience even richer: from exploring Canterbury to just spending time with others over a meal or during the organized events. Those moments mattered as much as the academic side, because they made it easy to connect, exchange ideas, and feel part of a wider community.</p> <p>Looking back, I’m grateful for the balance of learning, collaboration, and simply sharing experiences. The summer school wasn’t just about the science, but also about the people, the conversations, and the projects that will keep going long after. Thanks to everyone who made this possible.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="psychology"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[2025 Summer School of the European Association of Social Psychology, hosted at the University of Kent]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">2025 BioXPhi Summit in Basel</title><link href="https://damartinr.github.io/blog/2025/basel2025/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="2025 BioXPhi Summit in Basel"/><published>2025-07-03T15:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-07-03T15:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://damartinr.github.io/blog/2025/basel2025</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://damartinr.github.io/blog/2025/basel2025/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="2025-bioxphi-summit-in-basel">2025 BioXPhi Summit in Basel</h2> <p>I recently attended the <a href="https://ibmb.unibas.ch/en/public-outreach/projects-to-the-public/basel-oxford-nus-bioxphi-summit-2025/">2025 Basel-Oxford-NUS BioXPhi Summit</a>, and it was an incredible experience.
